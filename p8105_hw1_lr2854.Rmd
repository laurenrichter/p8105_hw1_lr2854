```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Problem 1

This problem is intended to emphasize variable types and introduce coercion; some awareness of how R treats numeric, character, and factor variables is necessary for working with these data types in practice.

Create a data frame comprised of:

- a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
- a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0
- a character vector of length 10
- a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

```{r prob1a, warning = FALSE}

prob1a_df = tibble(
  norm_sample_10 = rnorm(10),
  is_gt_0 = c(norm_sample_10 > 0),
  char_vec = letters[1:10],
  factor_vec = factor(
    c(rep("cow",4),
      rep("chicken",3),
      rep("dog",3)
      )
    )
)

prob1a_df
```
